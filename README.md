# Bot_Discord_ Project-
# Name: Chafi Khermouche / Din Kapo / Mouhsine M'Changama
PROJECT : Our programming project concerns the automation of a bot discord. Initially, its use is limited by the framework of the APE master's degree, and it is used to provide the courses requested. Secondly, it can be used to simulate a workshop in English. The bot sends out a discussion topic and opens different voice chat rooms for students to discuss.

#How to use the Bot 

First of all, to run the code, you need to create an environment on your PC using the terminal. Then, in this environment, you need to install Python and import the Discord.py libraries. You will also need to install the PyPDF2 package. Create a python file in this environment and launch it from the terminal. However, if you copy our code, you will need to change the token, as the Discord bot invalidates those put online on sites such as GITHUB. 

#Bot commands

Course automation

The !MasterAPE command: This command allows you to start a conversation with the bot in order to access the master APE courses. The bot will give you a list of APE master courses. Next, you must choose a subject number. Next, you must choose a number associated with a teacher. The next step is to choose a number associated with a chapter. The bot will send you the course in PDF format.

#Workshop in English

The !Workshop taille_groupe command: First of all, users who want to take part in the workshop need to go to the ‘Work shop group’ room. This command divides the participants between the different voice rooms and determines the number of participants in the group. Then, in the text room, a conversation topic will be assigned.   

#!Salon 
the !Room command: is used to create the rooms required to use the workshop command.
